# Cubs vs. White Sox Score Simulation Project

This project simulates the outcome of a baseball game between the **Chicago Cubs** and **Chicago White Sox** using three progressively detailed models:
1. **Team-Level Historical Score Model**
2. **Player-Level Statistical Aggregation Model**
3. **Injury-Adjusted Simulation Model**

The simulation estimates expected runs, win probabilities, and score distributions using real-world data and statistical modeling techniques.

##  Models Overview

### Model 1: Historical Team Score Simulation
- Uses average historical scores from the past two years.
- Poisson distribution used to simulate game outcomes.

### Model 2: Player Performance-Based Prediction
- Aggregates batting average, HR, RBI, and ERA for each team.
- Estimates expected runs from these statistics.

### Model 3: Injury-Adjusted Simulation
- Replaces injured players with substitutes based on real data.
- Computes updated expected scores and win probabilities using simulation.
